/**
 * Report intake limits — the ONE place both sides read them from.
 *
 * The dialog mirrors these so the submit button only enables when the server
 * will accept the text; the hard filters enforce them. They used to be two
 * literals that drifted (hogwarts enabled submit on any text while the shared
 * schema demanded 30 chars — a short team report drew the success toast and
 * created nothing). Import from here, never restate the numbers.
 *
 * Signed-in reporters get a lower floor than anonymous visitors: an account is
 * already a trust signal, and "قائمة الطلاب فارغة" (18 chars, 3 words) is a
 * perfectly good report from a teammate. Anonymous traffic keeps the stricter
 * bar that kills "test", "asdf", "doesn't work".
 *
 * Pure constants, no imports — safe in the client bundle.
